# Solving-a-maze-using-A-Algorithm

A* is a pathfinding alogirthm that uses a heuristic to make more informed decision about which steps to take. 

The agent uses A* search to find a path on a maze with obstacles it is unaware of. With repeated searches, the agent learns more about the maze, and generates new paths to reach the target.

Included in this repository are:
  3 kinds of A* alogorithms: Forward, Backward, and Adaptive.
  A class that can read mazes, store them, or randomly generate them. 
  A binary heap.
  Visulization for the pathfinding.
